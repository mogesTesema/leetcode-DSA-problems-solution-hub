Welcome to my personal hub of algorithmic problem‑solving: a curated and ongoing journey through data structures and algorithms, built for deep learning, consistent improvement, and showcasing real‑world coding capability.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository  
This repository serves three main goals:  
1. **Learning in public** – by solving, documenting, and publishing problems, I sharpen my skills and build a visible track record.  
2. **Quality over quantity** – each solution isn’t just “works”, it is written cleanly, commented purposefully, and reflects best practices such as time/space complexity analysis.  
3. **Reference & inspiration** – whether you're learning DSA or preparing for interviews, you’ll find clear, well‑explained solutions that can be studied, modified, and extended.

## 💡 What You’ll Find Here  
- Solutions to problems from LeetCode categorized by difficulty and topic (arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.).  
- For each problem: a clear problem title/number, my solution file, comments that cover approach reasoning, edge‑case handling, and complexity insights.  
- A consistent format for code readability and maintenance: naming conventions, simple structure, and self‑explanatory code blocks.  
- Periodic updates: I add new problems regularly, revisit older solutions for refactoring, and track algorithms I revisit as part of ongoing practice.

## 🔍 How to Use This Repository  
- Browse directory topics or use the search functionality to find a specific problem number or name.  
- Open a solution file and first **read the comments**: I outline the problem context, my thought process, and any key decisions—this is the real learning moment.  
- Run the code (in your local environment) and test variations. Try altering inputs, adding edge cases, or refactoring the logic; the point is active engagement, not just passive reading.  
- If you’re preparing for interviews, pick a problem, attempt your own solution first, then compare with the one here to uncover insights or alternative patterns.  
- Use the repository as a living journal: revisit earlier problems, refactor them, add annotations—or even fork the repo and build your own version.

## 🚀 Why It Matters  
Developing algorithmic skill is a **process**. It’s not about memorizing solutions—it's about building intuition, pattern recognition (sliding window, two pointers, recursion → DP conversions, graph traversal, etc.), and consistent reflection.  
By publishing this code publicly and committing regularly, I demonstrate *progress*, *discipline*, and *adaptability*—qualities that matter in real‑world development and interviews.

## 📈 My Commitments  
- New problems added **weekly** or biweekly, reflecting both new challenges and revisited old ones.  
- Refactoring older code—cleaner logic, updated commentary, improved complexity where possible.  
- If you find an issue, bug, or better approach—feel free to suggest via GitHub Issue or Pull Request. I believe in continuous improvement and community participation.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect  
I’m always open to collaboration, suggestions, and feedback. If you’re working through these topics too, or want to share alternate solutions, feel free to reach out and I’ll be happy to connect.  
Happy coding — let’s solve problems, build intuition, and grow together.
